diff -u allows one to compare two codes and identify typos. \

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does? \

\fs24 \cf0 \kerning1\expnd0\expndtw0 each increment is clearer. if autosaved, it might be saved in-between a commit or after too many commits. \

\b Reflect: Using Git to View History\
4/18/2016\

\b0 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?\
1. git log shows all commits\
2. git diff id1 id2 shows differences between the two ids. You can see exactly what lines have been added or deleted.\

Reflect: Confidence from Version Control\
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\b\fs28 \cf2 How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
\b0 \
I can use git checkout to locate approximately where the breakage happened, and use git diff to understand exactly what code broke it.\
It allows for exploration without worrying about having to go back and fix a project.\
